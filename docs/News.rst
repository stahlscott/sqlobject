SQLObject 3.7.0 (master)
========================

SQLObject 3.6.0
===============

Released 24 Feb 2018.

Minor features
--------------

* Close cursors after using to free resources immediately
  instead of waiting for gc.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix for TypeError using selectBy on a BLOBCol. PR by Michael S. Root.

Drivers
-------

* Extend support for oursql and Python 3 (requires our fork of the driver).

* Fix cursor.arraysize - pymssql doesn't have arraysize.

* Set timeout for ODBC with MSSQL.

* Fix _setAutoCommit for MSSQL.

Documentation
-------------

* Document extras that are available for installation.

Build
-----

* Use ``python_version`` environment marker in ``setup.py`` to make
  ``install_requires`` and ``extras_require`` declarative. This makes
  the universal wheel truly universal.

* Use ``python_requires`` keyword in ``setup.py``.

CI
--

* Run pymssql tests at AppVeyor again.

SQLObject 3.5.0
===============

Released 15 Nov 2017.

Minor features
--------------

* Add Python3 special methods for division to SQLExpression.
  Pull request by Michael S. Root.

Drivers
-------

* Add support for `pg8000 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pg8000>`_
  PostgreSQL driver.

* Fix autoreconnect with pymysql driver. Contributed by Shailesh Mungikar.

Documentation
-------------

* Remove generated HTML from eggs/wheels (docs are installed into wrong
  place). Generated docs are still included in the source distribution.

Tests
-----

* Add tests for PyGreSQL, py-postgresql and pg8000 at AppVeyor.

* Fixed bugs in py-postgresql at AppVeyor. SQLObject requires
  the latest version of the driver from our fork.

SQLObject 3.4.0
===============

Released 5 Aug 2017.

Features
--------

* Python 2.6 is no longer supported. The minimal supported version is
  Python 2.7.

Drivers (work in progress)
--------------------------

* Encode binary values for py-postgresql driver. This fixes the
  last remaining problems with the driver.

* Encode binary values for PyGreSQL driver using the same encoding as for
  py-postgresql driver. This fixes the last remaining problems with the driver.

  Our own encoding is needed because unescape_bytea(escape_bytea()) is not
  idempotent. See the comment for PQunescapeBytea at
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/libpq-exec.html:

    This conversion is not exactly the inverse of PQescapeBytea, because the
    string is not expected to be "escaped" when received from PQgetvalue. In
    particular this means there is no need for string quoting considerations.

* List all drivers in extras_require in setup.py.

Minor features
--------------

* Use base64.b64encode/b64decode instead of deprecated
  encodestring/decodestring.

Tests
-----

* Fix a bug with sqlite-memory: rollback transaction and close connection.
  The solution was found by Dr. Neil Muller.

* Use remove-old-files.py from ppu to cleanup pip cache
  at Travis and AppVeyor.

* Add test_csvimport.py more as an example how to use load_csv
  from sqlobject.util.csvimport.

SQLObject 3.3.0
===============

Released 7 May 2017.

Features
--------

* Support for Python 2.6 is declared obsolete and will be removed
  in the next release.

Minor features
--------------

* Convert scripts repository to devscripts subdirectory.
  Some of thses scripts are version-dependent so it's better to have them
  in the main repo.

* Test for __nonzero__ under Python 2, __bool__ under Python 3 in BoolCol.

Drivers (work in progress)
--------------------------

* Add support for PyODBC and PyPyODBC (pure-python ODBC DB API driver) for
  MySQL, PostgreSQL and MS SQL. Driver names are ``pyodbc``, ``pypyodbc``
  or ``odbc`` (try ``pyodbc`` and ``pypyodbc``). There are some problems
  with pyodbc and many problems with pypyodbc.

Documentation
-------------

* Stop updating http://sqlobject.readthedocs.org/ - it's enough to have
  http://sqlobject.org/

Tests
-----

* Run tests at Travis CI and AppVeyor with Python 3.6, x86 and x64.

* Stop running tests at Travis with Python 2.6.

* Stop running tests at AppVeyor with pymssql - too many timeouts and
  problems.

SQLObject 3.2.0
===============

Released 11 Mar 2017.

Minor features
--------------

* Drop table name from ``VACUUM`` command in SQLiteConnection: SQLite
  doesn't vacuum a single table and SQLite 3.15 uses the supplied name as
  the name of the attached database to vacuum.

* Remove ``driver`` keyword from RdbhostConnection as it allows one driver
  ``rdbhdb``.

* Add ``driver`` keyword for FirebirdConnection. Allowed values are 'fdb',
  'kinterbasdb' and 'pyfirebirdsql'. Default is to test 'fdb' and
  'kinterbasdb' in that order. pyfirebirdsql is supported but has problems.

* Add ``driver`` keyword for MySQLConnection. Allowed values are 'mysqldb',
  'connector', 'oursql' and 'pymysql'. Default is to test for mysqldb only.

* Add support for `MySQL Connector
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysql-connector>`_ (pure python; `binary
  packages <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/>`_ are not at
  PyPI and hence are hard to install and test).

* Add support for `oursql <https://github.com/python-oursql/oursql>`_ MySQL
  driver (only Python 2.6 and 2.7 until oursql author fixes Python 3
  compatibility).

* Add support for `PyMySQL <https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/>`_ - pure
  python mysql interface).

* Add parameter ``timeout`` for MSSQLConnection (usable only with pymssql
  driver); timeouts are in seconds.

* Remove deprecated ez_setup.py.

Drivers (work in progress)
--------------------------

* Extend support for PyGreSQL driver. There are still some problems.

* Add support for `py-postgresql
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-postgresql>`_ PostgreSQL driver. There
  are still problems with the driver.

* Add support for `pyfirebirdsql
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/firebirdsql>`_.There are still problems with
  the driver.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix MSSQLConnection.columnsFromSchema: remove `(` and `)` from default
  value.

* Fix MSSQLConnection and SybaseConnection: insert default values into a table
  with just one IDENTITY column.

* Remove excessive NULLs from ``CREATE TABLE`` for MSSQL/Sybase.

* Fix concatenation operator for MSSQL/Sybase (it's ``+``, not ``||``).

* Fix MSSQLConnection.server_version() under Py3 (decode version to str).

Documentation
-------------

* The docs are now generated with Sphinx.

* Move ``docs/LICENSE`` to the top-level directory so that Github
  recognizes it.

Tests
-----

* Rename ``py.test`` -> ``pytest`` in tests and docs.

* Great Renaming: fix ``pytest`` warnings by renaming ``TestXXX`` classes
  to ``SOTestXXX`` to prevent ``pytest`` to recognize them as test classes.

* Fix ``pytest`` warnings by converting yield tests to plain calls: yield
  tests were deprecated in ``pytest``.

* Tests are now run at CIs with Python 3.5.

* Drop ``Circle CI``.

* Run at Travis CI tests with Firebird backend (server version 2.5;
  drivers fdb and firebirdsql). There are problems with tests.

* Run tests at AppVeyor for windows testing. Run tests with MS SQL,
  MySQL, Postgres and SQLite backends; use Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5,
  x86 and x64. There are problems with MS SQL and MySQL.

* Add JsonbCol. Only for PostgreSQL.
  Requires psycopg2 >= 2.5.4 and PostgreSQL >= 9.2.

* For Python >= 3.4 minimal FormEncode version is now 1.3.1.

* If mxDateTime is in use, convert timedelta (returned by MySQL) to
  mxDateTime.Time.

Documentation
-------------

* Developer's Guide is extended to explain SQLObject architecture
  and how to create a new column type.
